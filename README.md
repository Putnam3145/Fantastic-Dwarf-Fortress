A mod which adds a variety of stuff to Dwarf Fortress.

There are two ways to install this mod: using [PyDwarf](https://github.com/pineapplemachine/PyDwarf) (just copy the whole source code into the scripts/putnam folder) or by downloading the pre-processed raws and merging them into the Dwarf Fortress folder.
